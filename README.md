# Valentine
An interactive Valentine’s Day web card with animated floating hearts, a photo background, and playful buttons. The card asks “Will you be my Valentine?” with Yes/No options — the No button shrinks and moves away with each click, while clicking Yes triggers a confetti explosion and celebration message.
